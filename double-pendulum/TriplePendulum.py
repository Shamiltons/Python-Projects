# Naturally, I immediately wondered whether I could reproduce this simlulation in Python.
# This post is the result.

# <!-- PELICAN_END_SUMMARY -->

# This should have been pretty easy. After all, a while back I wrote a [Matplotlib Animation Tutorial](https://jakevdp.github.io/blog/2012/08/18/matplotlib-animation-tutorial/) containing a double pendulum example, simulated in Python using SciPy's [``odeint`` solver](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy-0.17.0/reference/generated/scipy.integrate.odeint.html) and animated using matplotlib's [animation module](http://matplotlib.org/api/animation_api.html).
# All we need to do is to extend that to a three-segment pendulum, and we're good to go, right?

# Unfortunately, things are not so simple.
# While the double pendulum equations of motion can be solved [relatively straightforwardly](http://scienceworld.wolfram.com/physics/DoublePendulum.html), the equations for a triple pendulum are much more involved.
# For example, the appendix of [this document](https://www.nickeyre.com/images/triplependulum.pdf) lists the three coupled second-order differential equations that govern the motion of the a triple pendulum;
# here's a screenshot of just the first of those three:

# ![Equation Screenshot](http://jakevdp.github.io/images/eqn-screenshot.png)

# Yikes.

# Fortunately, there are easier approaches than brute-force algebra, that rely on higher abstractions: one such approach is known as [Kane's Method](http://docs.sympy.org/dev/modules/physics/mechanics/kane.html).
# This method still involves a significant amount of book-keeping for any but the most trivial problems, but the [Sympy package](http://sympy.org) has a nice implementation that handles the details for you.
# This is the approach I took to simulate the triple pendulum, borrowing heavily from  [Gede et al. 2013](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/267490975_Constrained_Multibody_Dynamics_With_Python_From_Symbolic_Equation_Generation_to_Publication) who present a nice example of Sympy's API for applying Kane's Method.

# ## The Code
#
# The following function defines and solves the equations of motion for a system of *n* pendulums, with arbitrary masses and lengths.
# It's a bit long, but hopefully commented well enough that you can follow along.
